# Make Rita Famous
Aimed at ages 18-25, the 1-2 minute game offers a quick look into the early life of a celebrity refugee. The game allows the player to help the singer collect music awards then gain a VIP pass to chat with Rita.

## Project Brief

This project was my second brief with my internship at BIZGEES. The brief:

* Select a celebrity who was a refugee.

* Compile the information and background.

* Create a short 30 second - 2 minute game aimed at age group 18 -25.

* The game is to allow the player to learn about the refugee.

* Use AI to aid the creation.

I chose the singer Rita Ora.

## Technologies used

For the project the aim was to use AI, mainly Rosebud AI (https://play.rosebud.ai/home)

On the platform a developer can clone games created by other developers and change them for their own purpose. 

I have chosen 2 games and combined them: 

The Junnkman: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/dd33d65e-27c0-45e8-9744-1de22a9d79ea Evolved from: 2D Playground 
Created by: hdc_to_ocp.  And the original 2D Playground.



Although Rosebud can generate AI images, I created all mine in Photoshop. 
Rosebud also allows the AI chat to change code, however, this didn't work for me so I went into the code myself and changed it.
